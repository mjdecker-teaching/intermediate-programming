Serious

    Breaking down a large problem, by solving a smaller version of the problem
    Accomplished, by a function/method calling itself

    Requirements for recursive solution:
        base case(s)
            // inputs that stop recursing, trivial answer (known answer). without infinite
        recursive cases(s) 
            // inputs that that lead to recursive call(s) possibly with other code
            // recursive calls need to arrive eventually at base case

Call stack:

    int foo(int a, int b) {

        int product = a * b
        int sum = product + bar(a, b);
        return sum;

    }

    int bar(int a, int b) {

        int sum = a + b;
        return sum;

    }

// recurence relation
// single recursion - single recursive call
// tail recursion - lab learn more why tail recursion more efficient
// better solved iteratively
factorial

// Hard iteratively, Recursive easy
// multiple recusion - multiple recursive calls
// Tower of Hanoi
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi
2^n - 1

// mutual recursion

Tree data structure lend themselves well to recursive methods
